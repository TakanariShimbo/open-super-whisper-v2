# Thread Management Implementation

This module provides thread-safe management for the Open Super Whisper v2 application. It ensures 
proper communication between threads and safe UI updates according to Qt's threading model.

## Core Components

### 1. ThreadManager

Acts as a central hub for thread-to-thread communication and safe UI updates. It provides:
- Task execution in worker threads
- Function execution in the main thread
- Timer management
- Hotkey handling
- Status updates

### 2. UIUpdater

Handles safe updates to UI components, ensuring they are only accessed from the main thread:
- Status bar updates
- Recording indicator updates
- Timer updates

### 3. TaskWorker

Executes long-running tasks in separate threads:
- Audio processing
- Transcription
- LLM processing
- Error handling

### 4. HotkeyBridge

Provides thread-safe integration with the hotkey system:
- Singleton pattern for global access
- Thread-safe callback processing
- Integration with native HotkeyManager

## Integration Testing

To ensure the thread management system works correctly, the following tests should be performed:

### Timer Functionality
1. Start recording and verify the timer updates correctly
2. Check that the timer updates in both the main window and indicator window
3. Verify the timer stops when recording is stopped

### Hotkey Processing
1. Test the main recording toggle hotkey
2. Test instruction set hotkeys
3. Verify that hotkeys remain responsive during processing

### Asynchronous Task Execution
1. Test audio processing with various file lengths
2. Test error handling by forcing errors (e.g., invalid API key)
3. Check that the UI remains responsive during processing

### UI Updates
1. Verify that all UI updates happen in the main thread
2. Check that status updates work correctly
3. Test indicator window updates
4. Verify that tab switching and text updates work properly

## Thread Safety Guidelines

When modifying the code, follow these guidelines to maintain thread safety:

1. Always use `Qt.ConnectionType.QueuedConnection` for cross-thread signal connections
2. Use `ThreadManager.run_in_main_thread()` instead of `QTimer.singleShot(0, func)`
3. Never directly update UI components from non-UI threads
4. Use the UIUpdater for all status-related updates
5. Ensure all hotkey callbacks are processed in the main thread
6. Mark UI update methods with `@pyqtSlot` to indicate they can be called from signals

Remember that in Qt, the rule is simple: UI objects must only be accessed from the main thread.
