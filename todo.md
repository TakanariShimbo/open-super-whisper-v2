# GUI Implementation Modification

## Explore Current Code Structure (Completed)
- [x] Examine project directory structure
- [x] Identify files related to GUI implementation
- [x] Identify components handling instruction sets and "active" concept
- [x] Understand current recording workflow (GUI dropdown and hotkeys)

## Implementation Details Found (Completed)
- [x] The "active" concept is now replaced with a "selected" concept in `GUIInstructionSetManager` in gui/dialogs/instruction_sets_dialog.py
- [x] Main window (gui/windows/main_window.py) uses the selected instruction set when starting recording from the GUI
- [x] Hotkeys are managed through HotkeyBridge and HotKeyManager
- [x] When recording starts via hotkey, it activates the instruction set associated with that hotkey
- [x] The core InstructionSetManager in old_core/instructions.py has already been updated to remove the "active" concept

## Remove "Active" Concept from Instruction Sets
- [x] Check if any further modifications are needed in old_core/instructions.py
  - [x] Ensure no active set related methods remain (only docstring reference which was kept for clarity)
- [x] Clean up GUIInstructionSetManager in gui/dialogs/instruction_sets_dialog.py
  - [x] Remove references to "active" set in load_from_settings
  - [x] Ensure all methods use "selected" concept consistently
  - [x] Commit pending changes that are already in the git diff
- [x] Update main_window.py to use dropdown selection consistently
  - [x] Ensure get_current_instruction_set() uses the selected set concept
  - [x] Update references from "active instruction set" to "selected instruction set"
  - [x] Add activate_instruction_set_by_name() method for backward compatibility
  - [x] Commit pending changes that are already in the git diff
- [x] Clean up hotkey handling to ensure it works with the "selected" concept
  - [x] Update references from "activate" to "select" in the hotkey handler
  - [x] Make sure instruction set hotkeys work correctly with selection
  - [x] Commit pending changes that are already in the git diff
- [x] Update resource labels and references to "active" in labels.py
  - [x] Commit pending changes that are already in the git diff

## Testing and Cleanup
- [x] Test GUI recording with dropdown selection
- [x] Test recording via hotkeys
- [x] Remove any unused code and clean up
- [x] Ensure no regressions in functionality

## Summary of Changes
- [x] Removed backward compatibility check for "ActiveSet" in settings
- [x] Added activate_instruction_set_by_name() method that delegates to select_instruction_set_by_name()
- [x] Updated references from "active" to "selected" in method names and comments
- [x] Updated hotkey handler to use "select" terminology instead of "activate"
- [x] Ensured all components now use the "selected" concept consistently

## Conclusion
- [x] All tasks have been completed successfully
- [x] The "active" concept has been completely removed from the GUI implementation
- [x] The GUI now uses the "selected" concept consistently
- [x] Backward compatibility is maintained through the activate_instruction_set_by_name() method
- [x] All changes have been committed to the repository
