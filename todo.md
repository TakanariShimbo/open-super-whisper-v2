# Super Whisper App Implementation

## 1. Project Setup
- [x] Review project structure and understand existing components
- [x] Examine core pipeline and instruction manager functionality
- [x] Understand the MVC pattern implementation in qt_mvc_demo
- [x] Create initial todo.md to plan implementation

## 2. Design MVC Architecture
- [x] Create directory structure following MVC pattern
- [x] Define Controller interfaces
- [x] Define Model interfaces
- [x] Define View interfaces

## 3. Core Models Implementation
- [x] Implement PipelineModel for handling transcription pipeline
- [x] Implement InstructionSetModel for managing instruction sets
- [x] Implement HotkeyModel for managing global hotkeys
- [x] Implement AudioRecorderModel (unnecessary, using core directly)

## 4. Controllers Implementation
- [x] Implement AppController as main application controller
- [x] Implement RecordingController (consolidated into AppController)
- [x] Implement TranscriptionController (consolidated into AppController)
- [x] Implement HotkeyController (consolidated into AppController)

## 5. Views Implementation
- [x] Implement MainWindow View
- [x] Implement recording controls UI components
- [x] Implement transcription result display components
- [x] Implement status indicators

## 6. Integration
- [x] Connect Models, Views and Controllers
- [x] Implement communication between components
- [x] Add event handling for hotkeys
- [x] Connect pipeline to UI components

## 7. Instruction Dialog Implementation
- [x] Create Model for Instruction Dialog (InstructionDialogModel)
  - [x] Define interface with the core InstructionManager
  - [x] Implement methods for CRUD operations on instruction sets
  - [x] Add persistence with QSettings
- [x] Create Controller for Instruction Dialog (InstructionDialogController)
  - [x] Define controller methods for updating instruction sets
  - [x] Implement signal handling between model and view
  - [x] Add methods for hotkey management
- [x] Create View for Instruction Dialog (InstructionDialog)
  - [x] Implement UI based on existing gui/dialogs/instruction_sets_dialog.py
  - [x] Create form layout for instruction set properties
  - [x] Add validation for user inputs
- [x] Connect Instruction Dialog components to main application
  - [x] Integrate with AppController
  - [x] Add menu option in MainWindow for launching dialog
  - [x] Ensure proper communication with existing models

## 8. Testing
- [ ] Test basic recording functionality 
- [ ] Test transcription process
- [ ] Test hotkey functionality
- [ ] Test instruction dialog functionality
- [ ] Integrate error handling and user feedback

## 9. Main Application Entry
- [x] Create main.py for running the application
- [ ] Resolve dependency and runtime issues

## 10. Summary

We have successfully designed and implemented a Super Whisper app using the MVC architecture:

1. **Models**:
   - PipelineModel: Encapsulates the core Pipeline functionality for recording and transcription
   - InstructionSetModel: Manages instruction sets using the core InstructionManager
   - HotkeyModel: Manages global hotkeys using the core HotkeyManager
   - InstructionDialogModel: Manages the data for the instruction sets dialog

2. **Controllers**:
   - AppController: The main controller that coordinates between models and views
   - InstructionDialogController: Mediates between the instruction dialog view and model
   - Handles user interactions, manages recording/transcription flow, and hotkey events

3. **Views**:
   - MainWindow: The main application window with recording controls and output displays
   - InstructionDialog: Dialog for managing instruction sets
   - Provides UI for transcription and LLM outputs, API key setting, and instruction set selection

4. **Integration**:
   - Connected all components following the MVC pattern
   - Implemented communication between components using signals and slots
   - Added support for global hotkeys to start/stop recording with different instruction sets
   - Created seamless integration between the main application and dialogs

Current focus:
- Testing the application functionality
- Ensuring proper error handling and user feedback

Next steps:
- Test the instruction dialog functionality
- Debug the application entry point
- Complete the testing of all components
