# Super Whisper App Implementation

## 1. Project Setup
- [x] Review project structure and understand existing components
- [x] Examine core pipeline and instruction manager functionality
- [x] Understand the MVC pattern implementation in qt_mvc_demo
- [x] Create initial todo.md to plan implementation

## 2. Design MVC Architecture
- [x] Create directory structure following MVC pattern
- [x] Define Controller interfaces
- [x] Define Model interfaces
- [x] Define View interfaces

## 3. Core Models Implementation
- [x] Implement PipelineModel for handling transcription pipeline
- [x] Implement InstructionSetModel for managing instruction sets
- [x] Implement HotkeyModel for managing global hotkeys
- [x] Implement AudioRecorderModel (unnecessary, using core directly)

## 4. Controllers Implementation
- [x] Implement AppController as main application controller
- [x] Implement RecordingController (consolidated into AppController)
- [x] Implement TranscriptionController (consolidated into AppController)
- [x] Implement HotkeyController (consolidated into AppController)

## 5. Views Implementation
- [x] Implement MainWindow View
- [x] Implement recording controls UI components
- [x] Implement transcription result display components
- [x] Implement status indicators

## 6. Integration
- [x] Connect Models, Views and Controllers
- [x] Implement communication between components
- [x] Add event handling for hotkeys
- [x] Connect pipeline to UI components

## 7. Testing
- [ ] Test basic recording functionality 
- [ ] Test transcription process
- [ ] Test hotkey functionality
- [ ] Integrate error handling and user feedback

## 8. Main Application Entry
- [x] Create main.py for running the application
- [ ] Resolve dependency and runtime issues

## 9. Summary

We have successfully designed and implemented a Super Whisper app using the MVC architecture:

1. **Models**:
   - PipelineModel: Encapsulates the core Pipeline functionality for recording and transcription
   - InstructionSetModel: Manages instruction sets using the core InstructionManager
   - HotkeyModel: Manages global hotkeys using the core HotkeyManager

2. **Controller**:
   - AppController: The main controller that coordinates between models and views
   - Handles user interactions, manages recording/transcription flow, and hotkey events

3. **View**:
   - MainWindow: The main application window with recording controls and output displays
   - Provides UI for transcription and LLM outputs, API key setting, and instruction set selection

4. **Integration**:
   - Connected all components following the MVC pattern
   - Implemented communication between components using signals and slots
   - Added support for global hotkeys to start/stop recording with different instruction sets

Current challenges:
- We encountered runtime issues when trying to run the application
- We need to further debug dependencies and potential import issues

Next steps:
- Debug the application entry point
- Potentially refactor import statements to fix package resolution
- Test the application functionality once running
